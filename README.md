```
Shell into the puppetmaster
```sh

```
Create SSL certificates && ensure puppetmaster service is started.

sudo systemctl status puppetmaster && sudo systemctl start puppetmaster 
```

Log into the agents and issue the following command, ensure the puppet agent service is DISABLED:

```

Go back to the puppetmaster and view and accept the pending certficate requests.

Deploy the entire 'mediawiki' web application in a single puppet run! Do this on both agents.
```sh
